# Setting it up for the first time

Before using network wrangler, you’ll need to:

•	install Cube 6.4.4 or newer (http://www.citilabs.com). Note that Cube is a proprietary software and a license will be required.

•	clone network wrangler from GitHub (https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/NetworkWrangler). When it's cloned, you should see this python script in your local GitHub directory: C:\Users\ftsang\Documents\GitHub\NetworkWrangler\scripts\build_network_mtc.py

•	install various python modules that network wrangler uses. (For most current python users, the required modules are xlrd, simpleparse, and numpy. If you are using python 3, you may need win32 as well. If additional module is needed for your specific set up, you’ll get error messages on screen to indicating which python module is needed.

•	 install Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
