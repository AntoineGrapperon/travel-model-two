## Computing Environment

The hardware and software MTC uses to execute Travel Model Two are described on this page. To date, MTC has not experimented enough with the model to define the minimum or ideal hardware configuration. As such, the description here is for a hardware set up that is sufficient -- not optimal. It is important to note that both the software and model structure are highly configurable and flexible; depending on the analysis needs, the required computing power could vary dramatically.

### Hardware
MTC uses four identical servers with the following characteristics:
* Operating system: Microsoft Windows Server 2007 with Service Pack 2, 64-bit edition;
* Processors: Two Intel Xeon X5570 @ 2.93 GHz (i.e., two quad-core processors with hyper-threading capability);
* Memory (RAM): 96.0 GB

As discussed in the [System Design](#System-Design) section, these four computers can act in different roles, each requiring different amounts of memory and computing power. The four computers are named as follows: `mainmodel`, `satmodel` (for satellite), `satmodel2`, and `satmodel3`. As discussed in the [System Design](##System Design) section, the `mainmodel` computer plays a specialized role in the system design; the satellite machines each play identical and completely interchangeable roles.

### Software
The following software are required to execute the MTC travel model.

#### Citilabs Cube Voyager
The travel model currently uses version 6.1.X of [Citilabs Cube](http://www.citilabs.com/) or software. The Cube software is used to build skims, manipulate networks, manipulate matrices, and perform assignments. A Cube license that supports up to 9,999,999 nodes is required.

#### Citilabs Cube Voyager 64bit Matrix I/O DLL
The CT-RAMP software, as discussed below, needs to access data stored in a format dictated by Cube. This is accomplished through a 64-bit DLL library specifically for matrix I/O,which must be accessible through the `PATH` environment variable.  To install the DLL:

* Run `VoyagerFileAPIInstaller.msi`, which is included in the `CTRAMP\runtime` folder
* Ensure `VoyagerFileAccess.dll` is in the `CTRAMP\runtime` folder
* Ensure the Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 redistributable is installed on the matrix server machine.  Make sure to get version “110” DLLs (`MSVCR110.dll` and `MSVCP110.dll`).  These files can be obtained from the [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx). Download and install `vcredist_x64.exe`.

#### Citilabs Cube Cluster
The Cube Cluster software allows Cube scripts to be multi-threaded. In the current approach, the travel model uses 64 computing nodes across four machines. The Cube scripts can be manipulated to use any number of computing nodes across any number of machines, provided each machine has, at a minimum, a Cube Voyager node license (for the time being, MTC has found 64 nodes on a single machine to be the most effective -- in terms of reliability and run time -- approach). Cube Cluster is not strictly necessary, as the Cube scripts can be modified to use only a single computing node. Such an approach would dramatically increase run times.

#### Java and CT-RAMP
MTC's travel model operates on the open-source Coordinated Travel - Regional Activity-based Modeling Platform (or CT-RAMP) developed by [Parsons Brinckerhoff](pbworld.com). The software is written in the [Java](java.com/en) programming language.  CT-RAMP requires the 64-bit Java Development Kit version 1.6 or later to be installed on each computer running the CT-RAMP software. The Java Development Kit includes the Java Runtime Environment. The 64-bit version of the software allows CT-RAMP to take advantage of larger memory addresses. The details of setting up and configuring the software are presented in the [Setup and Configuration section](## Setup and Configuration) of this guide.

#### Python
Certain network processing programs are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python must be installed on the computer executing the Cube scripts -- `mainmodel` in MTC's configuration.

#### Python Rtree library
The open source [Python `rtree` library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Rtree/) is required for a script that dynamically codes link area type based on land use data.  The `rtree` library provides an efficient spatial index for looking up all spatial units within a buffered distance from each spatial unit.

#### Microsoft Excel
The CT-RAMP software allows discrete choice models to be specified via so-called [Utility Expression Calculators](http://analytics.mtc.ca.gov/foswiki/Main/UtilityExpressionCalculator). These files are Excel-based.

#### Remote Execution and Stop Utilities
The Microsoft [`PsKill`](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896683.aspx) and [`PsExec`](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx) programs are used to remotely kill programs and execute programs.
